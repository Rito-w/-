Abstract
Learning robust sentence representations for Chinese syn-
onym detection is a critical challenge, particularly when
expressions are irregular, domain-specific, or semantically
subtle. Existing contrastive learning methods such as Sim-
CSE (Gao, Yao, and Chen 2021), DiffCSE (Chuang et al.
2022), and MoCoSE (adapted from MoCo (He et al. 2020))
exhibit performance limitations on such fine-grained tasks
due to insufficient domain adaptation, simplistic loss designs,
and inadequate modeling of asymmetric semantic relation-
ships. In this work, we propose SynCSE, an enhanced con-
trastive learning framework tailored for Chinese synonym
sentence representation. Our method integrates active nega-
tive sampling beyond in-batch negatives, a projection-based
architecture to improve semantic separation, and a weighted
contrastive loss function that incorporates soft similarity
scores and temperature scaling. We conduct extensive experi-
ments on the Yidu-N4K dataset using six Chinese pre-trained
models, including BERT, RoBERTa, and MacBERT. Results
show that SynCSE consistently outperforms previous meth-
ods, achieving up to 0.713 Pearson and 0.68 Spearman corre-
lation, demonstrating its effectiveness for nuanced synonym
representation tasks.
Instruction
Learning effective sentence representations is a fundamen-
tal task in natural language processing (NLP), supporting
a wide range of downstream applications such as seman-
tic similarity, question answering, and information retrieval.
In particular, synonym sentence matching—determining
whether two sentences express semantically equivalent or
nearly equivalent meanings—is critical for tasks such as
terminology normalization, paraphrase detection, and query
understanding. While general-purpose pre-trained mod-
els like BERTBERT (Reimers and Gurevych 2019) have
achieved great success in many language tasks, recent ad-
vances in contrastive learning, such as SimCSE and its vari-
ants, have further improved sentence representation learning
by aligning semantically similar instances and pushing apart
dissimilar ones. Despite their impressive performance on
general textual similarity benchmarks, existing contrastive

learning methods exhibit limited effectiveness in special-
ized domains such as Chinese synonym detection. This task
presents unique challenges: synonyms in Chinese often ap-
pear as highly diverse expressions, especially in technical
or domain-specific contexts like medicine, where terms may
include abbreviations, mixed language constructs, or stylis-
tic variations. Furthermore, existing methods typically treat
all positive sentence pairs as semantically identical, ignor-
ing the fact that synonymy is a graded property rather than
a binary one. In this paper, we propose SynCSE, an en-
hanced contrastive learning framework designed specifically
for Chinese synonym sentence representation. Our approach
addresses several limitations of prior work:
• We introduce an active negative sampling strategy that se-
lects semantically hard examples beyond in-batch neg-
atives, improving the model’s ability to distinguish be-
tween close-but-not-equivalent expressions.
• We incorporate a non-linear projection layer with dropout
regularization to refine the output embeddings and adapt
them to domain-specific semantic nuances.
• Unlike traditional contrastive losses that treat all pairs
equally, we propose a weighted loss that integrates
sentence-level similarity scores, enabling the model to
capture graded semantic relationships.
To evaluate the effectiveness of SynCSE, we conduct com-
prehensive experiments on the Yidu-N4K medical synonym
dataset using six widely-used Chinese pre-trained language
models. Our results demonstrate consistent and significant
improvements over baseline methods such as SimCSE, Dif-
fCSE, and MoCoSE, achieving up to 0.713 Pearson and
0.68 Spearman correlation. These gains confirm that incor-
porating domain-aware strategies and fine-grained supervi-
sion into contrastive learning substantially improves syn-
onym representation quality. Our contributions are summa-
rized as follows:
• We analyze the limitations of existing contrastive learning
methods for Chinese synonym representation and high-
light the challenges specific to domain-specific synonym
matching.
• We propose SynCSE, a novel framework that integrates
active negative sampling, projection-layer enhancement,
and weighted contrastive loss for improved sentence em-
beddings.
• We empirically validate our method across multiple Chi-
nese pre-trained models, achieving new state-of-the-art
results on a challenging medical synonym matching
benchmark.
Related Work
Contrastive Sentence Embedding Methods
Contrastive learning has become a dominant approach for
sentence representation learning. SimCSE (Gao et al., 2021)
introduced a minimalistic framework where dropout is used
to create positive pairs for self-supervised training. The su-
pervised variant further incorporates natural language infer-
ence (NLI) datasets to construct hard positive and negative
pairs. DiffCSE(Chuang et al. 2022) extends SimCSE(Gao,
Yao, and Chen 2021) by applying dropout difference con-
straints and consistency regularization to mitigate represen-
tation collapse and enhance robustness. Inspired by MoCo
(He et al., 2020), MoCoSE applies a momentum encoder
and negative queue to provide a larger and more stable set of
negatives, which is particularly beneficial in unsupervised
settings.
Limitations in Domain-Specific Tasks
While these methods perform well in general domains, their
effectiveness degrades in domain-specific scenarios such as
medical synonym standardization. Medical terms often con-
tain abbreviations, misspellings, and hierarchical concepts
that are difficult to capture without domain adaptation. Fur-
thermore, datasets like Yidu-N4K(Li et al. 2020) contain
graded similarity levels between sentence pairs, which are
ignored by standard contrastive loss functions that treat all
positive pairs as equally similar. Additionally, existing meth-
ods lack sufficient hard negatives, which are crucial for dis-
tinguishing between semantically close but non-equivalent
terms in medical contexts(Wang et al. 2022).
Our Contributions in Context
To address these gaps, we propose several targeted improve-
ments. First, a domain-adaptive projection layer is intro-
duced to enhance the model’s ability to encode special-
ized medical semantics. Second, we implement an active
hard negative sampling mechanism that draws from the full
dataset, improving the difficulty and informativeness of con-
trastive pairs. Third, we develop a similarity-aware con-
trastive loss that incorporates sample-specific weights and
temperature scaling, allowing the model to better capture
fine-grained differences in meaning. These innovations al-
low our approach to consistently outperform prior methods
across different Chinese backbone models and evaluation
benchmarks, especially in challenging synonym detection
tasks within the medical domain.
Preliminaries
Contrastive Sentence Embedding
Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful method for
sentence representation learning. The goal is to bring seman-
tically similar sentence pairs closer in the embedding space,
while pushing apart dissimilar ones.
Given an anchor sentence vector a, a positive example
p, and k negative examples {n1, . . . , nk}, the commonly
used NT-Xent loss (Normalized Temperature-scaled Cross
Entropy Loss) is defined as:
L(a, p, {nj}) = −log
exp(sim(a, p)/τ)
exp(sim(a, p)/τ) + Pk
j=1 exp(sim(a, nj)/τ)
(1)
Here, sim(·, ·) denotes the cosine similarity, and τ is a
temperature hyperparameter controlling the smoothness of
the softmax distribution.
SimCSE Framework
SimCSE (Gao, Yao, and Chen 2021) is a contrastive frame-
work for sentence embeddings that leverages dropout-based
augmentation. In the unsupervised setting, two indepen-
dently encoded versions of the same sentence form a positive
pair, while all other sentences in the batch act as negatives.
Let hi and h+
i denote the two representations of the same
sentence, and {hj}j̸=i be representations of other sentences
in the batch. The batch-level NT-Xent loss becomes:
Li = −log
exp(sim(hi, h+
i )/τ)
P2N
j=1 1[j̸=i] exp(sim(hi, hj)/τ)
(2)
In the supervised version, positive and negative pairs are
derived from natural language inference (NLI) datasets such
as entailment vs. contradiction.
Sentence Pooling and Projection Layer
To obtain sentence-level embeddings from the output of a
Transformer encoder, different pooling strategies are com-
monly used:
• CLS pooling: use the embedding of the [CLS] token.
• Mean pooling: average over all token embeddings.
• Pooler output: use the encoder’s built-in pooler layer.
To enhance representation expressiveness, many con-
trastive frameworks adopt a projection head:
z = ReLU(Wh + b)
(3)
where h is the pooled embedding from the encoder, and
W, b are parameters of the linear projection layer.
Medical Synonym Matching as an Asymmetric
Task
In many real-world applications such as medical synonym
normalization, sentence matching is inherently asymmetric:
one side may be a verbose, noisy phrase, and the other a
concise, standardized term. Moreover, semantic similarity in
these domains is often graded rather than binary.
However, traditional contrastive learning frameworks
such as SimCSE and MoCoSE assume symmetric relation-
ships and treat all positive pairs as equally similar. This mo-
tivates the need for improved loss functions that account for:
• Graded similarity: using similarity scores or soft labels.
• Hard negative mining: emphasizing semantically close
distractors.
• Asymmetric modeling: encoding directional relation-
ships.
These challenges are addressed in our improved frame-
work, described in Section method.
Method
In this section, we present our improved contrastive frame-
work for Chinese synonym sentence embedding. Our
method addresses the limitations of existing models by in-
corporating (1) an enhanced negative sampling strategy, (2)
a domain-adaptive projection module, and (3) a similarity-
aware contrastive loss. The overall architecture is illustrated
in Figure ??.
Model Overview
We follow the contrastive learning paradigm with a Siamese
network architecture, where sentence pairs are encoded us-
ing a shared transformer encoder such as BERT. Given an
input triplet consisting of an anchor sentence xa, a positive
sentence xp, and a set of negative samples {xnj}, the model
computes their representations via:
hx = Encoder(x),
zx = Projection(hx)
(4)
We adopt CLS pooling or mean pooling to obtain hx,
followed by a trainable projection layer defined as:
zx = ReLU(W · hx + b)
(5)
where W and b are learnable parameters. This projection
encourages the model to map sentence embeddings into a
task-specific space optimized for synonym matching.
Enhanced Hard Negative Sampling
Unlike SimCSE, which only relies on in-batch negatives, we
introduce an active sampling strategy that augments each
anchor-positive pair with k negative examples drawn from
a large candidate pool. The sampling procedure ensures that
negatives are semantically close but not equivalent, thus en-
forcing more discriminative training.
For each anchor-positive pair (xa, xp), we randomly sam-
ple k sentences {xnj} such that:
xnj ∈C \ {xa, xp},
sim(xa, xnj) > δ
(6)
where C is the corpus and δ is a similarity threshold to
control negative hardness.
This approach yields harder and more diverse negatives
compared to batch-based sampling or MoCo-style momen-
tum queues.
Similarity-Aware Contrastive Loss
To better reflect graded similarity in tasks such as medi-
cal synonym matching, we design a new contrastive loss
that incorporates both sample-specific weights and multi-
negative structure.
Given anchor embedding za, positive embedding zp, and
k negative embeddings {znj}, the weighted contrastive loss
is defined as:
Li = −wi · log





exp(sim(za, zp)/τ)
exp(sim(za, zp)/τ) +
kP
j=1
exp(sim(za, znj)/τ)





(7)
Here: - sim(·, ·) is cosine similarity, - τ is the tempera-
ture parameter, - wi is a confidence weight computed from
human-annotated similarity scores or normalized alignment
scores.
This loss formulation allows the model to learn fine-
grained similarity distinctions, especially important in semi-
equivalent medical terms.
Training Strategy and Optimization
We adopt a two-stage training procedure:
1. Unsupervised Pretraining: We initialize the encoder
with a base model (e.g., bert-base-chinese) and
pretrain it on a large general corpus (e.g., LCQMC) us-
ing unsupervised SimCSE or DiffCSE objectives.
2. Domain-Specific Finetuning: The pretrained encoder is
then finetuned on domain-specific synonym datasets such
as Yidu-N4K, using our similarity-aware contrastive loss
and hard negatives.
We apply the following training optimizations:
• Layer-wise learning rates: A lower learning rate for pre-
trained encoder layers and a higher rate for projection and
loss-specific modules.
• Dropout and regularization: Applied to both encoder
and projection layers to improve generalization.
• Early stopping: Based on validation Pearson/Spearman
correlation.
Experiments
We conduct comprehensive experiments on Chinese sen-
tence similarity tasks with a focus on domain-specific syn-
onym matching. The goal is to evaluate the performance of
our improved method against several baseline models under
multiple encoder backbones.
Datasets
We use two datasets:
• LCQMC: A large-scale Chinese question matching cor-
pus used for unsupervised pretraining.
Figure 1: Overview of the SynCSE framework. It includes active negative sampling, projection enhancement, and weighted
contrastive loss.
• Yidu-N4K: A medical synonym dataset derived from the
CHIP 2019 clinical term normalization task. It provides
fine-grained semantic similarity annotations, suitable for
evaluating synonym representation.
Backbone Models
We evaluate all methods across six widely used Chinese pre-
trained language models:
• bert-base-chinese
• chinese-bert-wwm
• chinese-bert-wwm-ext
• chinese-electra-base
• chinese-macbert-base
• chinese-roberta-wwm-ext
Methods Compared
We compare the following settings:
• SimCSE (unsupervised): Pretrained on LCQMC with
standard SimCSE loss.
• SimCSE (supervised): Further fine-tuned on Yidu-N4K
using SimCSE’s original supervised loss.
• DiffCSE: Two-stage training with DiffCSE on LCQMC
and Yidu-N4K.
• MoCoSE: Uses a momentum encoder and queue mecha-
nism on LCQMC and Yidu-N4K.
• Ours (optimized): Improved version with enhanced hard
negative sampling, projection layer, and weighted loss, di-
rectly fine-tuned on Yidu-N4K.
Evaluation Metrics
We report two standard correlation metrics between pre-
dicted similarity scores and human annotations:
• Spearman correlation: Measures rank consistency.
• Pearson correlation: Measures linear correlation.
Main Results
Table 1 summarizes the results across all models and back-
bones.
Our method outperforms all baselines consistently, with
gains of over 0.1 in both Spearman and Pearson correlations
across most backbones.
Component Analysis
To evaluate the impact of each proposed component, we
conduct controlled ablations by removing (1) the projection
layer, (2) the hard negative sampling, and (3) the weighted
contrastive loss. Results (based on BERT-WWM) are:
• w/o projection: Spearman drops from 0.672 to 0.559
• w/o hard negatives: drops to 0.618
• w/o weighted loss: drops to 0.596
This demonstrates that all components contribute to the
final performance, with weighted loss playing the most crit-
ical role.
Observations
• Supervised SimCSE does not perform well on Yidu-N4K,
likely due to its rigid binary supervision scheme.
• DiffCSE shows modest improvement but still struggles
with domain-specific variation.
• MoCoSE performs the worst, suggesting that queue-based
negatives are less effective in this task.
• Our optimized framework adapts well across all back-
bones, showing strong generalizability.
Analysis
Effectiveness of Proposed Method.
Across all six pre-
trained backbones, our improved method consistently
achieves the highest Spearman and Pearson correlation
scores, with gains ranging from +0.05 to +0.15 compared
to the best-performing baseline. This validates the effective-
ness and generalizability of our method across both general
and whole-word masking variants of Chinese BERT models.

Impact of Domain-Specific Design.
We observe that con-
ventional supervised SimCSE underperforms even com-
pared to its unsupervised variant. This suggests that binary
entailment-based supervision is suboptimal for fine-grained
medical synonym tasks, where similarity is a continuous
value. In contrast, our similarity-aware contrastive loss bet-
ter captures this gradient, improving both ranking (Spear-
man) and scoring (Pearson).
Component Contribution.
Our ablation studies show that
removing either the projection layer, hard negative sam-
pling, or the weighting mechanism significantly hurts per-
formance. Notably, removing the weighted contrastive loss
leads to a Pearson drop of over 0.09 on BERT-WWM, high-
lighting its critical role in modeling nuanced semantic simi-
larity.

method,
backbones
with

masking
(e.g.,

show

gains.
We attribute this to their stronger ability to capture token-
level structure, which is especially helpful for short clinical
phrases.
Why MoCoSE Fails.
MoCoSE performs the worst in all
cases, often worse than even vanilla SimCSE. This is likely
because its queue-based negative sampling introduces out-
dated or easy negatives in our domain, which are insuffi-
cient for learning fine-grained synonym distinctions. Ad-
ditionally, MoCo’s momentum encoder may degrade under
domain shift, leading to representation drift.
Overall Observation.
Our method demonstrates robust
generalization and task-specific gains, proving that tailor-
ing contrastive learning to domain structure and supervision
style leads to significant improvements in medical synonym
matching. We also confirm that gains are stable across pre-
training variants, indicating that our improvements are not
architecture-specific but methodology-centric.
Conclusion
In this paper, we propose an improved contrastive learn-
ing framework for Chinese synonym sentence embedding,
tailored for domain-specific semantic similarity tasks such
as clinical term normalization. Our method introduces three
key innovations: (1) an active hard negative sampling strat-
egy that emphasizes fine-grained discrimination, (2) a learn-
able projection module to enhance domain adaptation, and
(3) a similarity-aware weighted contrastive loss that captures
continuous semantic alignment.
Extensive experiments on the Yidu-N4K medical dataset
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
strong baselines including SimCSE, DiffCSE, and MoCoSE
across six Chinese backbone encoders. Ablation studies con-
firm the contribution of each component, with the weighted
loss and hard negative sampling playing particularly crucial
roles.
Our results highlight the limitations of existing sentence
embedding methods when applied to nuanced synonym de-
tection tasks and show the importance of task-specific design
in contrastive learning. Future work includes extending our
framework to multi-turn clinical dialogue normalization and
exploring alignment-based pretraining objectives on larger-
scale synonym knowledge bases.
